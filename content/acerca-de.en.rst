This blog is written by Daniel Fuentes, to keep things learned while
programming in Python and leave some notes and examples.

Unless otherwise indicated, the examples are under `the MIT license (also known
as the X11 license) <http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php>`_
So practically they are free to do whatever they want with them.

As I have profiles on various sites, is a bit difficult to keep in this page,
so you can find more information about me in `https://www.danielfuentes.org/en/
<https://www.danielfuentes.org/en/>`_

And if someone wants contact me, try:

- `my twitter <https://twitter.com/dbfuentes>`_
