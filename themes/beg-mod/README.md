This is a modification of the [Hugo](http://gohugo.io/) theme ["BEG"](https://github.com/dim0627/hugo_theme_beg/) by [Daisuke Tsuji](https://yet.unresolved.xyz/) under the MIT license.

The main change is adding multilanguage support, to use it on my website [Python Mania](https://www.pythonmania.net/).
